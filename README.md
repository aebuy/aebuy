# Hi, I’m Ahmet 👋

I’m a Software Engineering (Co-op) student at the University of Ottawa with a strong interest in backend systems, low-level programming, and AI-assisted developer tools. I enjoy working close to the system while still thinking about scalability, clarity, and developer experience.

I’ve worked in production environments, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and built software that prioritizes correctness, maintainability, and real-world usability.

## Experience

**Software Development Intern — Trend Micro**  
During my internship at Trend Micro, I worked on backend and platform tooling focused on data ingestion, automation, and developer efficiency. I built Python-based data pipelines, contributed to an AI-assisted ticket resolution system using vector search and LLM context, and worked with Kubernetes, Helm, and cloud infrastructure. I also investigated data integrity issues across distributed systems and documented solutions for long-term maintainability.

**Software Developer — MERGE Robotics (FRC)**  
As part of an FRC robotics team, I developed Java software for competition robots over multiple seasons. This experience strengthened my understanding of real-time constraints, teamwork under pressure, and writing reliable software for hardware-integrated systems.

## Projects

**Tutor Scheduling App (Android)**  
An Android application that allows students to book tutoring sessions, tutors to manage availability, and administrators to approve and manage accounts. The project focuses on role-based workflows, clean object-oriented design, and reliable user interactions.

**Memory Card Game (C++)**  
A text-based memory card game for multiple players, built using modern C++ and object-oriented design. The game includes scoring, turn management, and multiple gameplay modes designed to keep the code extensible and easy to evolve.

## Tech & Tools

I work primarily with Python, Java, and C++, and I’m comfortable across Linux environments, Git-based workflows, and containerized systems. I’ve used tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Redis, SQL, vector databases, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms in both academic and professional settings.
